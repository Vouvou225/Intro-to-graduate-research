summary of A cluster analysis of basketball players for each of the five traditionally defined positions
goal: group basketball players into similar clusters according to their playing styles(pg,sg,sf,pf,c)
the data is from the basketball-reference.com website, 2000/2001 to 2015/2016 NBA season except 2011/2012(boycott)
five man analysis condition: played together at least 21 matches for 240 total min(565 five men lineup for 15 seasons found)
the player who played more than 25% in a position in a single season were included in that position
6040 observations for 72 variables(joined tables on player's name, season, and team name)
cluster analysis :    PG: 426 players   SG: 490 players  SF: 544 players  PF: 522 players  C: 525 players
we conducted advanced statistics and shooting statistics
advanced statistics yielded more efficient results by reducing playing times and teams'effect(which caused mistakes in evaluating the players)
shooting statistics were selected for a detailed analysis of the offensive characters of the players
To examine the style of players, we focused on the shooting distance of the field goal attepmts
the number of clusters were unknown in advance. It was performed with a minimum of 4 clusters and a maximum of 10 groups for each position. They used Internal Validity Indices to determine the optimal number of clusters.
cluster analysis for PG: "Ball Handler"(high usage and assist); "Floor General"(high assist,efficiency,steals,dribbling); "Shooter"(high shooting 3s, low free throw); "Role Player"(complimentary to the team)
Cluster analysis for SG position: "Shooter"(high 3s%,high true shooting%,low free throw); "Warrior"(high block and offensive rebound); "Role Player"; "Team Leader"(high usage,high PER)
Cluster analysis for SF position: "Team Leader"(high usage and high PER); "Shooter"(high 3s%,high true shooting, low FT%); "Warrior";"Role Player".
Cluster analysis for PF position: "Shooter:; "Big Man"(PER,DRB), "Role Player"; "Team Leader", "Warrior"
Cluster analysis for C position: "Warrior"; "Shooter"; "Big Man"; "Team Leader"; "Rim Protector"(BLK,high TO); "Role Player"
metrics used: Adjusted plus-minus (APM), average points differential(APM), and the percentage of clusters on winning teams were analyzed while determining the prominent clusters.
