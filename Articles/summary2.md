## Clustering performance in the European Basketball according to players’ characteristics and contextual variables

This articles focuses on identifying differences in the game performance profiles of basketball players in Euroleague and European national championships; and to analyse the influence of player-related (e.g. age or court-position) and contextual variables (e.g. distance travelled or game break) in players’ game-related statistics. To do so, the article used two step cluster to identtify different performance player profiles and discriminant analysis to analyze differences within those playing profiles.  A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the selected variables into the different clusters obtained. Pairwise comparisons were assessed using the Bonferroni post hoc test. The leave-one-out method of cross-validation was used to evaluate the usefulness of discriminant functions when classifying new data. The variables analyzed were divided into three groups and defined as follows: (i) player-related: players’ age, court-position and minutes played; (ii) contextual variables: distance travelled, between the teams’ headquarters and the city where the games were played (kilometers) and game break, number of rest days between games (days); and (iii) game-related variables: field-goals made and attempted, 3-point made and attempted, free-throws made and attempted, points, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, total rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and personal fouls.
