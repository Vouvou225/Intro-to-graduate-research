## Clustering performances in the NBA according to players’ anthropometric attributes and playing experience

In this article, they are trying to group players into similar clusters based on anthropometric characteristics and playing experience. After doing so, they will explore the distribution of players within the obtained cluster. The data have been obtained from open-access official NBA record during 2015-2016 regular season. Some criteria have been established to come up with the final data  using a descriptive design. Players with less than 500 minutes a season and 5 minutes or less per game were excluded. Games with score difference equal to or less than 10 points were included which gave a total of 699 regular season balanced games. this method limited the sample to 354 players with 12724 performance records(57% of the total sample). A total of 20 variables considered. A random sub-sample of 20 games were observed by basketball coaches with more than 5 years of experience in basketball performance analysis).  A two-step cluster with log-likelihood as the distances measure and
Schwartz’s Bayesian criterion was carried out to group basketball players into the different groups using experience, weight and height as variables. A descriptive discriminant analysis was conducted to identify which variables best discriminate the previously obtained clusters. Cross-validation analysis evaluated the usefulness of discriminant functions when classifying new data.



## Clustering Professional Basketball Players by Performance by Riki Patel

Coming from www.basketball-reference.com, this article tried to reclassify players from 2016-2017 regular season into groups. Reduction techniques such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) employed to visualize player performance in two dimensions then K-means clustering will be employed to find similarities among groups of players on the scatterplot. Riki Patel came up with 18 variables while excluding variables that do not reflect positive player performance such as turnovers, fouls ... He also excluded the player's classic position, the team each player belongs to to minimize its influence on clustering. Focusing on k-means clustering, he used three validation methods to select the best number of clusters:  within-sum-of-squares, the silhouette score, and the gap statistic which led to four groups: "The Paint Protector", "The supporters", "The Shooters", "The Insiders". To conclude, he used visual representations and linear regression to determine the relationship between clusters and nba team success.


## Similarities
- around same number of variables
- data comes from one regular season
- specific criteria to meet before being considered into final dataset
- exploring data within different clusters to see how it behave



## Differences
 -  descriptive design VS positive player performance (to come up with final dataset)
 -  two step cluster vs validation methods (for clustering)
