## Clustering performances in the NBA according to players’ anthropometric attributes and playing experience

In this article, they are trying to group players into similar clusters based on anthropometric characteristics and plaing experience. After doing so, they will explore the distribution of players within the obtained cluster. The data have been obtained from open-access official NBA record during 2015-2016 regular season. Some criteria have been established to come up with the finlal data  using a descriptive design. Players with less than 500 minutes a season and 5 minutes or less per game were excluded. Games with score dfference equal to or less than 10 points were included which gave a total of 699 regular season balanced games. this method limited the sample to 354 players with 12724 performance records(57% of the total sample). A total of 20 variables considered. A random sub-sample of 20 games were observed by basketball coaches with more than 5 years of experience in basketball performance analysis).  A two-step cluster with log-likelihood as the distances measure and
Schwartz’s Bayesian criterion was carried out to group basketball players into the different groups using experience, weight and height as variables. A descriptive discriminant analysis was conducted to identify which variables best discriminate the previously obtained clusters. Cross-validation analysis evaluated the usefulness of discriminant functions when classifying new data.
